#Map Distance Challenge

This challenge focuses on using Pygame's different event types to drag a measuring line between two points on a map. The code provided
 allows the user to select from a menu of six regional world maps and displays the map on the screen, the rest is up to you.

#Challenge

Allow the user to drag a line between two points on a map and display the map distance 
between those two points. You will need to calculate the distance of the line in pixels then convert it to miles.
 There is a dict, SCALES, in prepare.py that contains the scale factor for each map: distance in pixels * scale = 
 distance in miles.

#Achievements

**Screw the Imperialists** - Display the distance in kilometers 

**End of the Rainbow** - Make the distance line change color depending on its length

**Connect the Dots** - Allow the user to set multiple waypoints and display the total distance (this will probably entail clicking to place each waypoint rather than dragging)
